# EHRGym

![EHRGym Logo](ehrgym_logo.png)

**EHRGym** is a containerized environment for training and evaluating computer-use agents in an Epic-like electronic health record (EHR) workflow.

It combines:

- A web-based EHR built with **Next.js + TypeScript**  
- An **OpenEnv-compliant environment server** built with **FastAPI + Playwright**

The environment exposes `reset()`, `step(action)`, and a `state` object so an agent can interact with the EHR through a real browser.

> **Note:** This project uses **synthetic data only** (no PHI).  
> Not affiliated with or endorsed by Epic Systems.

## Clinical focus (initial)

Provider workflows:

- Reviewing the chart (encounters, labs, prior notes)  
- Writing progress and encounter notes  
- Placing and signing orders

---

## What you get

- **Epic-like charting UI**
  - Chart Review (Encounters / Labs / Clinical Notes)
  - Notes authoring
  - Orders with signing workflow
  - Encounter sign/close

- **OpenEnv-compliant RL environment**
  - Typed `Action`, `Observation`, `State`
  - `reset()` / `step()` / `state()`
  - Real browser interaction (Playwright)

- **Task library**
  - Chart review → note → orders → sign/close

- **Synthetic patient pipeline**
  - Baseline: **Synthea + FHIR-shaped ingest**

---

## Goals

- OpenEnv compliance with typed `Action` / `Observation` / `State` models  
- Docker-first deployment and reproducible containers  
- Next.js EHR interface supporting:
  - chart review (encounters, labs, clinical notes)
  - order entry (labs / meds / imaging) with sign workflow
  - note authoring (progress & encounter notes)
- Task-based RL episodes (patient + scenario + objective + scoring rubric)  
- Synthetic patients only (no PHI), with realistic longitudinal timelines and standard coding where feasible

---

## Out-of-Scope

- Pixel-perfect Epic cloning (We emulate workflows & info layout)  
- Full enterprise EHR scope on day one (MAR, billing, scheduling, in-basket, prior auth, etc.)

---

## Architecture

A single container runs two processes:

1. **Next.js EHR app (port 3000)**
   - Serves the UI and required API routes (patient data, notes, orders, signing)
2. **OpenEnv environment server (port 8000)**
   - FastAPI server exposing OpenEnv API
   - Launches and controls headless Chromium via Playwright
   - Implements `reset()`, `step()`, `state`, scenario sampling, and reward computation

**Data layer**
- SQLite via Prisma (portable and fast)  
- On `reset()`, the environment recreates/truncates the DB and reseeds patients, encounters, labs, notes, orders, and scenario ground truth. Optionally use a DB snapshot + copy-on-reset for speed.

---

## EHR UI layout (Epic-like)

- **Entry view:** patient list / schedule-like page → select patient → open chart  
- **Chart shell**
  - Activity sidebar: Summary, Chart Review, Orders, Notes (optional), Encounter (close/sign)
  - Patient banner: synthetic demographics and key flags (synthetic ID, age/sex, allergies)
- **Chart Review tabs**
  - Encounters: timeline, encounter detail, linked notes/orders
  - Labs: table + trend view, filtering, abnormal flags
  - Clinical Notes: list by type/date/author, open note
- **Notes**
  - Create Progress Note tied to current encounter
  - Structured sections (SOAP)
  - Problem-oriented A/P that links naturally to orders
- **Orders**
  - Search/select from constrained preference list
  - Configure parameters (dose/frequency, lab timing)
  - Statuses: Draft → Pending Signature → Signed

**RL instrumentation**
- Stable selectors (`data-testid` / `data-qa`) for tabs, lab rows, order rows, note controls  
- Accessible labels (`aria-label`) so agents can use the accessibility tree

---

## OpenEnv Interface

**Actions**
- Low-level computer-use actions (mouse clicks, drag, scroll, keypress, type, wait)
- Optional high-level actions for curriculum/debug (e.g., `click(selector)`, `fill(selector,text)`, `goto(path)`, `select_patient(patient_id)`)

**Observations**
- Goal/instruction text
- Downscaled screenshot (base64 PNG)
- Current route/URL and active activity context
- Optional DOM snapshot and/or accessibility tree
- Metadata (timing, action success, structured errors)

**State**
- `episode_id`, `step_count` + environment fields:
  - `patient_id`, `encounter_id`, `scenario_id`
  - `rubric_progress`
  - `cumulative_reward`

**Rewarding**
- Terminal success when objective is satisfied (e.g., correct note signed + correct orders signed)  
- Shaping rewards for meaningful substeps (navigate, find target lab, place required order, sign)  
- Penalties for invalid actions, navigation errors, unsafe/irrelevant orders, excessive steps

---

## Tasks

Scenarios are packaged as specs and optionally generated at reset. Example task families:

- **Chart Review → Labs**
  - Find most recent creatinine; evaluate AKI criteria
  - Trend hemoglobin over last 3 values; document in progress note
- **Chart Review → Encounters**
  - Locate discharge summary; extract follow-up plan
  - Identify prior antibiotic exposure from previous encounter orders
- **Clinical Notes**
  - Open most recent consult; summarize recommendations
- **Progress note authoring**
  - Complete SOAP note with required elements and grounded facts
- **Orders**
  - Place specific orders with correct parameters; sign
- **Close/finish encounter**
  - Signed note + signed orders + required fields

**Curriculum**
- Phase 0: unit skills (navigate, open tabs, filter labs, open note)  
- Phase 1: single objective (place one order, sign one note)  
- Phase 2: multi-step (review → note → orders → sign/close)

---

## Synthetic patients

Baseline approach:

- Use Synthea to generate longitudinal synthetic records (encounters, conditions, meds, labs/vitals, procedures, etc.), exportable as FHIR  
- Treat FHIR R4 concepts as the internal “shape” even if stored relationally  
- Use standard coding when feasible:
  - LOINC for labs
  - SNOMED CT for problems/findings/procedures
  - RxNorm for meds

**Notes gap (free-text)**
- Template-based notes from structured facts (easy to score, less diverse)  
- Constrained LLM-generated notes grounded strictly in chart facts (more realistic, needs guardrails)  
- Hybrid: deterministic skeleton + constrained paraphrase

**Scenarios** layer on top of base patients as teaching cases (e.g., DKA, CHF, pneumonia, AKI, GI bleed) with explicit ground truth objectives:
- required orders
- required note elements
- critical facts that must appear in the note

---

## Performance and Training Approach

- Browser simulation throughput is usually the bottleneck, not GPU  
- Start with demonstrations (scripted Playwright expert) → supervised behavioral cloning  
- Move to RL after BC reliably solves simpler tasks  
- Run a modest number of env containers concurrently (e.g., 4–16)  
- Keep observations efficient (downscale screenshots; optionally omit DOM/a11y on “easy mode”)

---

## Logging and Evaluation

**Logging per step**
- Action, success/failure, reward components, UI errors

**Episode artifacts**
- Final note text
- Orders placed/signed
- Optional screenshots for debugging

**Evaluation**
- Deterministic test suites with fixed seeds  
- Metrics: task success rate, steps-to-completion, unsafe/irrelevant order rate, note completeness/grounding

**Safety**
- Synthetic data only (no PHI)  
- Constrained formulary and order catalog  
- If LLM-generated notes are used, enforce grounding checks (facts must be supported by chart)

## Repository layout

```
apps/ehr/            Next.js EHR UI (TypeScript)
env_server/          FastAPI OpenEnv server + Playwright control
tasks/               scenario specs, rubrics, fixtures
synthetic/           Synthea generation + FHIR ingest + seed tooling
prisma/              schema + migrations
docker/              Dockerfiles + entrypoints
```

---

## Quickstart

This section will be filled in once the initial container wiring lands. Expect:

- one command to build/run the environment container  
- an env server endpoint on `:8000`  
- the EHR UI on `:3000` for debugging  
- a minimal example agent loop calling `reset()` / `step()`

---

## Contributing

- Keep all data synthetic  
- Add `data-testid` / `aria-label` for any new interactive UI element  
- New tasks should include:
  - objective text
  - ground truth artifacts (required orders/note fields)
  - rubric scoring rules
  - deterministic seed behavior
